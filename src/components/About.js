                <p> I'm a Quality Assurance Specialist with 2 years of experience. I find it really cool, but I can't unleash my full potential in such a position. Since I can remember I have liked to create pretty things.  I also consider myself passionate about technology and what is associated with it. The front-end is a great combination of both of these worlds. I've been learning <strong>programming</strong> for over a year and I'm completely in love with it.
                Most of my free time I spend on gym and computer games. </p>
